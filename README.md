# aws-vpc-privatelink-demo
Demonstration of how to access a Database across accounts using VPC Interface Endpoints (via PrivateLink)

## Architecture
![alt text](https://github.com/gravelgrinder/aws-vpc-privatelink-demo/blob/main/architecture-diagram.png?raw=true)

## Prerequisite
1. Create a role to assume in the Destination (cross-acct) Account.  Use the `init/init.tf` script to create the role.
2. Make sure the user of the `main-acct` has the proper IAM policy attached to assume the role in the `cross-acct` account.
3. The `04-Misc-Resources.tf` script is not required.  It was used to provision resources to test the DB and NLB.  Remove it if you don't want to provision extra resources.

## Steps
1. Run the following to Initialize the Terraform environment.

```
terraform init
```

2. Provision the resources in the Terraform scripts

```
terraform apply
```

3. Get the RDS IP address
```
dig +short `terraform output --raw rds_address`
```

4. Confirm the correct target IP in the NLB Target Group.  Set it to the values from step #3 above and then run `terraform apply` if it's different.

5. Connect to the `djl-win-server` EC2 instance and confirm you __**can successfully**__ reach the database.  Your connection string should look like the one below.  You will have to replace the variable `vpce_dns_name` with the approprate VPC endpoint DNS name from the Terraform outputs.  __The connection should be successful.__
```
mysql --host=${vpce_dns_name} --user=foo --password=foobarbaz djl
```

6. Connect to the `djl-win-server2` EC2 instance and confirm you __**can successfully**__ reach the database.  Your connection string should look like the one below.  You will have to replace the variable `vpce_dns_name` with the approprate VPC endpoint DNS name from the Terraform outputs.  __The connection should be successful.__
```
mysql --host=${vpce_dns_name} --user=foo --password=foobarbaz djl
``` 

7. Remove the Security Group reference for `tf_sg1` from the VPCE Security Group `tf_sg3_vpce`.  Remove it from the AWS Console or run the following...
```
terraform destroy --target aws_security_group_rule.allow_db_ingress_for_ec2_sg1
```

8. Connect to the `djl-win-server` EC2 instance again and this time confirm you are __**unable**__ to reach the database.  __**The connection should time out.**__

## Notes to Consider
* Add notes here

## Clean up Resources
1. To delete the resources created from the terraform script run the following.  You will need to do this in the base directory then in the `./init` directory.
```
terraform destroy
```


## Security/Management Point of Control
1. VPC Service "Allow Principals".
2. VPC Endpoint Allow Security Group to Security Group referencing.
3. VPC Endpoint Policy
